This ran perfectly fine on my emulator.  Everything necessary was there and the way it was organized looked pretty good.  I think the theme could be changed a little bit to look more professional but all the information was there.  The navigation worked well and it was very simple to use.  I only have one emulator so I could not test the sizing adjustment but it looked good on mine.  The code looks organized well but you might want to add more notes to make it easier for others to look at. Nice job.
